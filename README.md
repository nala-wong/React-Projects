# React-Projects

## Overview

- DOM focuses approach VS Data / Declarative approach

  - Cons of using DOM: Working with DOM is slow but JS is super fast
  - Cons of declarative approach: Need to rendering the whole application if there is an update to data

- React only renders the place where the data is updated instead of the entire application

- JSX

  - Easier to create React element
  - Babel that convert HTML tag into React code
  - When select an element and then suddenly being unselected, it means that the web page is rendering that element

- Props

  - Automatically loop through collection of data

- State

  - Whenever state changes, React will render the webpage
  - Store data in state

  ```
  React.useState()
  ```

- Handling event

- Working with forms

- useEffect

- webpack
  - bundle.js is saved in memory instead of on hard disk thus loading is super fast
